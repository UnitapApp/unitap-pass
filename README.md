# Unitap Pass

Unitap Passes are a VIP pass for Unitap. Normal users have to re-link their BrightID every period and manually choose up to 5 offerings from gas tap, token tap, and prize tap. Addresses holding a Unitap Pass are pre-verified (since they already went through Aura verification) and never have to re-link their BrightID.
A Genesis Pass holder doesn’t even have to visit Unitap to have prize tap offerings delivered to them. The Unitap team will select and deliver a prize tap offering to each holder’s wallet address each period for each Genesis Pass they hold, with no gas or interaction needed.
The more Genesis Passes someone holds, the more prize tap offerings they will have automatically delivered–one offering per Genesis Pass.
Genesis Passes are minted on Eth mainnet, but we can deliver offerings to the same address on other networks. If a non-compatible address is used on another network, we can have the user sign a message (gasless) specifying their preferred delivery address on that network.
